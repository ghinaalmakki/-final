        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions:</h1>
        <ul>
            <h2>Q: When will my stuff ship?</h2>
            <li>A: Shipping times depend varying by country. For the USA, it may take up to 2 weeks before delivery. Outside the USA, why are you even ordering stuff from my website? I'm not advertising that much.</li>
            <h2>Q: Is that anime?</h2>
            <li>A: No. Anime is Japanese Cartoons. Stop asking me this. It's my art. Some of it is creatively inspired by anime, but <i>no.</i></li>
            <h2>Q: When did you start drawing?</h2>
            <li>A: If you read my about page, you would know. It was around October of 2021. Go fact check yourself.</li>
            <h2>Q: What is the return policy?</h2>
            <li>A: Return policy? Why would you ever want to return something you bought from me? Are you clinically insane?</li>
            <h2>Q: What if my item gets lost in the mail?</h2>
            <li>A: Get a search party.</li>
            <h2>Q: How long will it take out of stock products to be stocked again?</h2>
            <li>A: Maybe you should've bought it while it was in stock. Sucks to suck, I guess.</li>
            <h2>Q: My item arrived broken. Can I get a refund or replacement?</h2>
            <li>A: No.</li>
        </ul>
