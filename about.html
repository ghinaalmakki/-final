        <p>I began drawing in October of 2021. At the time, I wasn't extremely interested in art as a hobby, 
            but I had several friends who were, and already some creative interest in other subjects, 
            such as writing, or story telling. I've consistently been practicing art since then, with encouragement from friends who were previously into art,
            and now I do it frequently! Digital art is one of the mediums I do particularly, working on both Procreate on the iPad and the insert name here tablet</p>
